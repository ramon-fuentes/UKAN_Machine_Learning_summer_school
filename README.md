# UKAN_Machine_Learning_summer_school
This repository contains the PDF notes and Jupyter notebooks from the 2019 edition of the UK Acoustics Network (UKAN) Machine Learning summer school. 


The intention of this summer school was to provide a grounding on basic machine learning, and to link this to acoustics applications. 

We decided to place an emphasis on supervised learning and more specifically regression models, but touched on unsupervised learning towards the last day. 

The course took place as follows:

 - Day 1 - Linear models for regression
 - Day 2 - Nonlinear models for regression and regularisation / ridge regression
 - Day 3 - Kernel Machines with an emphasis on kernel ridge regression
 - Day 4 - Unsupervised learning, with an emphasis on density estimation.
